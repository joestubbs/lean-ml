Lean-ML
-------

Code examples and poc's for working with Lean programmatically 
in Python. This repo is using PyPantograph, which must be built locally
using Poetry (note the reference to a local build in this project's 
pyproject.toml file). To build it, we followed the instructions here
https://centaur.stanford.edu/PyPantograph/setup.html, i.e., 
cloned the repo and used poetry to build the wheel. 

We also depend on an installation of Lean. See the lake-manifest.toml file.
